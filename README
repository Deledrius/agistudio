QT AGI Studio, release 1.2.1

About
=====

AGI (Adventure Game Interpreter) is the adventure game engine used by
Sierra On-Line(tm) to create some of their early games. QT AGI Studio
(formerly known as Linux AGI Studio) is a program which allows you to
view, create and edit AGI games. Basically, it is an enhanced port of
the Windows AGI Studio developed by Peter Kelly.

The program contains very little platform specific code so brave ones
are encouraged to try it on other operating systems that the QT
library support


Availability
============

QT AGI Studio is available at http://agistudio.sourceforge.net/
The project is licensed under the GPL, GNU General Public License.
See COPYING for details.


System requirements
===================

Linux:  GNU make, g++, X Window System, QT library

The program is now being developed with QT version 3.1

NAGI or Sarien AGI interpreter is recommended to run games.
Sarien is available at http://sarien.sourceforge.net/
and NAGI at http://www.agidev.com/nagi.html
Sarien is more focused on portability and NAGI on compatibility
with Sierra's original AGI interpreter. Both are free.

WINDOWS NOTE: Since there is currently no GPL compatible
version of native QT 3 library for Windows (a version which
requires Cygwin XFree86 port exists), there is no way to
legally compile the program as a native Windows application
(the Cygwin XF86 currently traps all X applications inside a
giant "desktop window"). If we can reach all the people who
have contributed to the project, we will later make a new release
with a license that explicitly permits linking with non-free
versions of QT.


Building
========

Run "make" in the src subdirectory. If the supplied Makefile doesn't work,
you can either fix it or use tmake to generate a makefile for your platform:

 tmake agistudio.pro -o Makefile

If you don't have tmake, you can download it at http://www.trolltech.com

Make assumes that QT is installed and working (in particular, the QTDIR
environment variable is properly set)


Installation and setup
======================

The binary is called agistudio and will be built in the src subdirectory; you
can copy it to any path convenient to use (e.g. /usr/local/bin). In order to
use the help and an example game template, copy them to any convenient place
and specify the appropriate paths in the "Settings" menu when you'll run
agistudio.

AGI studio has its own help viewer, but you can also view the help with
any HTML browser.

If agistudio complains that it can't load qt shared library, then set the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to the path which contains libqt.so.*.

Using
=====

Please read the online help. Note that if you want to use existing games'
files, all the filenames must be in lower case.
