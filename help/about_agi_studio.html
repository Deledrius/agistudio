QT AGI studio is an enhanced port of the Windows AGI Studio v.1.31 developed by Peter Kelly. It is designed to closely resemble the original program, however some (hopefully non-critical) features are missing and some new features are added.

The picture editor is a port of the MSDOS Picedit developed by Lance Ewing.
