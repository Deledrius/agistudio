<h1>About this help</h1>
The QT AGI studio online help was converted from the original (Windows) AGI Studio online help. Therefore, "I" in this help almost everywhere refers to Peter Kelly - the author of the Windows AGI studio.
<p>
The name "AGI studio" refers to the QT AGI Studio. There are a few differences between the QT port and the native Windows version, the relevant help text has been changed, but there is no list of the differences.
