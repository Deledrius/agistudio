<B>Description</B><p>
<p>
This command allows you to add a view to the visual picture screen in memory. Cel CELNO of loop LOOPNO of view VIEWNO is drawn on the picture at X,Y with a priority of PRI. If MARGIN is 0, 1, 2 or 3, 
the base line of the object (the bottom row of pixels of the cel) is given a priority of MARGIN. Since priority is taken into account, so you can use add.to.pic to add views behind other parts of the 
picture. 
<p>
Note that the view must be loaded before you use it with add.to.pic. This can be done with the <a href="load_view.html">load.view</a> command.<p>
