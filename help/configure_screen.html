PLAYTOP is the top line of the playing area. This is normally set to 1. It should always be set to something between 0 and 3, since the playing area is 168 pixels high (21 lines) and should not go 
off the screen.

INPUTLINE is the line on which the player is prompted for input. This is normally set to 22.<p>
STATUSLINE is the line on which the current score and sound on/off status are displayed. This is normally set to 0.<p>
