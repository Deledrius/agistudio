<h1>Displaying text on screen</h1>
For text display purposes, the AGI screen consists of 25 lines (numbered 0-24) and 40 columns (numbered 0-39). Each text character is 8 screen pixels (4 AGI pixels) wide and 8 screen pixels high. 
Note that this gives a total screen resolution of 320x200, even though the area that pictures are displayed in and objects are placed is only 168 pixels high. The top line of the screen is normally 
reserved for the status line and menu, and the bottom three lines are normally reserved for player input and other text display (in some early versions of the interpreter, text from commands like 
<a href="print.html">print</a> was displayed down here instead of in windows).
