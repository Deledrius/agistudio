<h1>Getting started</h1>
The best way to get started with the AGI logic language is by looking at the code of existing games. At the moment, there is no complete tutorial available, so this is the best way to get a feel for the 
language and how certain things are done. This help file is designed mainly as a reference, although it does contain a few general introductory topics. You should start by reading these, which will 
hopefully give you an idea about what the main features of the system are. Also, there is some useful information in the readme.txt for the template game.
