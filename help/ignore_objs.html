<B>Description</B><p>
<p>
Object oA is allowed to move through other objects, i.e. it's baseline is allowed to touch another object's baseline.<p>
If oA stops because it runs into another object, it will keep going once that object moves out of the way (provided it is not stopped or it's direction changed before then).<p>
