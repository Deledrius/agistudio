<h1>The OBJECT file</h1>
The OBJECT file contains a list of inventory items (objects) that the player may possess during the game. Each item is numbered, and has a room number assigned to it. This room number is the room in 
which the object can be found. 
<p>
It is not necessary to use these room numbers - it is up to the programmer to decide, but if they are used then the obj.in.room command can be used to find out if the object is in the current room 
when the player tries to get it. 
<p>
Room 255 is the player's inventory, so any inventory items the player is to have at the start of the game should have their room number set to this.<p>
Note: Do not confuse <B>inventory objects</B> with <B>screen objects</B>. These are two completely different things. Inventory objects (or "inventory items") are things that the player carries 
round with them during the game. Screen objects are <a href="view_descr.html">views</a> that are displayed on screen and represent things like characters and props. All the commands in the logic programming language 
that are called (something).obj refer to screen objects, except for show.obj and show.obj.v. Usually when the word "object" is used in the logic programming documentation it means screen object.
