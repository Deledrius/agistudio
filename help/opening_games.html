<h1>Opening games</h1>
Before you can work on a game, you must open it. To do this, select 'Open' from the 'File' menu and then select directory containing the game you want to edit. This directory must contain a valid AGI 
version 2 or version 3 game. 
<p>
Any changes you make to the game will be written to disk whenever you perform an operation such as adding or deleting a resource. In the built-in editors, the game is updated when you save or compile 
the resource.
