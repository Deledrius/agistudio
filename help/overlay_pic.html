<p>
overlay.pic(vA);<p>
<B>Description</B><p>
<p>
overlay.pic does the same thing as <a href="draw_pic.html">draw.pic</a>, except that the visual and priority screens are not cleared. This means that picture vA is drawn on top of the existing picture. Note that 
because fills only work on white surfaces, fills in picture vA which are not on a white part of the existing picture wont work. It's generally best not to use fills in pictures that you intend to 
overlay. 
<p>
Remember to use <a href="show_pic.html">show.pic</a> to update the screen once the picture has been overlayed.<p>
Make sure the picture is loaded into memory before overlaying it.<p>
