<h1>Project Status</h1>
Since February 1998, I have not done any work on AGI Studio as I have lost interest in AGI. However in April 1999 I discovered there was a group of people who were interested in further developing 
the program, to add features to it that were not in existing versions. Therefore, I decided to release the source code for the program. 
<p>
This release, version 1.31a, is available at http://www.ozemail.com.au/~ptrkelly/agi with the accompanying source code. See the file README.TXT for more information about the source code. <p>
This program may be distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. For details, see the file COPYING.TXT that comes with the program.<p>
I will add links to the page mentioned above to other versions of AGI Studio as they become available.<p>
