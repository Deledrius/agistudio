<h1>Project Status</h1>
Since February 1998, Peter Kelly has not done any work on AGI Studio after losing interest in AGI. However in April 1999 Kelly discovered there was a group of people who were interested in further developing the program, to add features to it that were not in existing versions. Therefore, it was decided to release the source code for the program. 
<p>
    This release, version 1.4.00, is available at https://github.com/Deledrius/agistudio with the accompanying source code. See the file README.md for more information about the source code.
