<p>
set.key(nCODE1,CODE2,cA);<p>
<B>Description</B><p>
<p>
The key determined by the combination of nCODE1 and nCODE2 is assigned to controller cA. You can assign multiple menu items and keys to the one controller, for example most game functions like save, 
restore, quit etc. usually have both a menu item and a key. 
<p>
To assign a key by it's ASCII code, set nCODE1 to the ASCII code you need (these can be obtained from an ASCII chart) and leave nCODE2 as 0. There are a few special codes:<p>
<pre>
nCODE1  Key
 1-26   CTRL-A-Z
 8      Backspace (CTRL-H)
 9      Tab (CTRL-I)
 13     Enter (CTRL-M)
 27     Esc
 32     Space
</pre>
However, there are some keys and key combinations which use extended codes. For these, nCODE1 should be 0 and nCODE2 should be one of the values listed below (these are all standard PC-Keyboard 
codes, taken from the Epson GW-BASIC 3.20 manual.)
