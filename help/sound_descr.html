<h1>Sound resources</h1>
<B>Sound</B> resources contain all the sound effects and music used in a game. They consist of three musical voices plus one sound effect voice. The format is based on the sound capabilities of the 
IBM PC Junior, for which the interpreter was originally written. On standard PCs only the first music voice is played, because the only sound device available to the PC at the time was the internal 
speaker. There is no sound card support in the original PC version of the interpreter, but hopefully any new interpreters that are written will support this.

Other systems such as Macintosh and Amiga supported the other voices as well.<p>
