<h1>Text editor</h1>
The text editor is included so you can edit text files without having to switch to another application such as notepad. This is especially handy when you are doing logic programming and you need to 
edit a file which is included in your logic using the #include command. It is also integrated with the logic editor - if a text file is used in a logic with the #include command and it contains an 
error, the compiler will bring up the text editor with the appropriate file and hilight the appropriate line so you can fix the error. Note that when you compile a logic, all open text files that are 
referred to by that logic are automatically saved.

Usage of the text editor is pretty self explanatory - it is very similar in operation to programs like notepad. You can open it from the Tools menu or the toolbar.<p>
