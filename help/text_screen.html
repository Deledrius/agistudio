<p>
text.screen();<p>
<B>Description</B><p>
<p>
Switches the interpreter to text mode (40x25). This should only be used to display text on screen, and not to use menus, print statements, receive commands from the player or manipulate graphics as 
it does not have proper support for these things. It is handy for displaying text on a blank screen because you do not lose the graphics screen when you use it. 
<p>
Once you have finished in text mode, you should use the <a href="graphics.html">graphics</a> command to switch back.<p>
