<h1>Trace mode</h1>
The AGI Interpreter has a built in trace mode, which is useful for examining the operation of logics and tracking down problems. When it is turned on (either by the game issuing the 
<a href="trace_on.html">trace.on</a> command or by the player pressing the SCROLL LOCK key), a window is displayed on the screen showing commands and their parameters as they are executed. 
<p>
Before trace mode is used, the <a href="trace_info.html">trace.info</a> command must be used to initialize trace mode. It is not necessary to use this, but if it is not used then the command names will not be 
displayed in the trace window (only the command numbers). Flag 10 must be set in order to enable trace mode. 
<p>
The user can then activate trace mode by using the SCROLL LOCK key. Pressing this key while trace mode is on will turn it off.<p>
