unknown178()<p>
<B>Description</B><p>
<p>
The purpose and proper name of this command is not known.<p>
The reason for the name not being known is that the command names were obtained from the trace logic found in some games, which gives a list of commands used by the built-in trace mode. This list 
must have been created at a time when there were 169 commands, because commands 170 and above were not listed there. Once someone works out what the command does, a name will be made up for it. 
<p>
The number of paramaters is known, but not the type of parameters. Therefore, the parameters in the unknown commands are all set to numbers at present.<p>
